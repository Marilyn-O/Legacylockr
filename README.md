**A decentralized platform for creating and storing digital time capsules containing messages, photos, videos, or NFTs that unlock at a future date or event.**  

## **Overview**  
Legacylockr is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to securely store digital memories, messages, and assets in **encrypted time capsules** that automatically unlock at a predetermined time or upon a specified on-chain event.  

Whether you want to:  
- 📜 **Leave a message for your future self**  
- 🎁 **Create a surprise gift that unlocks on a special date**  
- 📸 **Preserve memories (photos, videos) for later viewing**

## **Key Features**  

### **1. Multi-Format Support**  
Store different types of content in your capsule:  
- ✉️ **Text messages**  
- 🖼️ **Images & Photos**  
- � **Videos & Audio clips**  
- 🏷️ **NFTs & Digital Collectibles**  
- 🔗 **External links (URLs)**  

### **2. Flexible Unlock Conditions**  
Capsules can be set to unlock based on:  
- **⏰ Time-Based Unlock** (e.g., "Open on January 1, 2030")  
- **📅 Block Height** (e.g., "Unlock after Bitcoin block 1,000,000")  
- **📡 On-Chain Events** (e.g., "Unlock when ETH hits $10,000")  
- **🔑 Multi-Signature Release** (e.g., "Require 3/5 signatures to open")  

### **3. End-to-End Encryption**  
- 🔐 All content is encrypted before being stored on-chain or in decentralized storage (IPFS/Arweave).  
- 🛡️ Only the recipient (or specified unlockers) can decrypt the capsule.  

### **4. Immutable & Tamper-Proof**  
- ⛓️ Stored on blockchain for permanent, censorship-resistant records.  
- 🔍 Cryptographic proofs ensure no one can alter or open capsules prematurely.  

### **5. Transferable & Inheritable**  
- 💌 Assign capsules to friends, family, or future generations.  
- 🏦 Set up inheritance conditions (e.g., "If I don’t renew in 10 years, transfer to my heir").

## **How It Works**  

### **1. Create a Capsule**  
- Upload content (text, media, NFTs).  
- Choose an unlock condition (date, event, or custom trigger).  
- Encrypt & store on-chain/IPFS.  

### **2. Lock & Fund Maintenance**  
- Pay a small fee to keep the capsule active (optional for long-term storage).  
- Capsule remains locked until conditions are met.  

### **3. Automatic Unlock**  
- ⏳ Time-based capsules unlock automatically.  
- 🔄 Event-based capsules check oracles/blockchain data.  
- 🔓 Once unlocked, the recipient can decrypt and access the contents.

## **Use Cases**  

### **Personal & Emotional**  
- 👶 **Letters to future children**  
- 💌 **Messages to your future self**  
- 💔 **Breakup letters that unlock after a cooling-off period**  

### **Financial & Legal**  
- 📜 **Will & testament execution**  
- 💰 **Vesting crypto assets for future release**  
- 🏛️ **Document leaks set to unlock if a key disappears**  

### **Fun & Social**

## **Why Blockchain?**  
Traditional cloud storage or email delays lack:  
- **🔒 True immutability** (files can be deleted/modified).  
- **⏳ Guaranteed execution** (no third-party can censor or block access).  
- **🛡️ Cryptographic ownership** (only the intended recipient can open it).  

By using **smart contracts + decentralized storage**, TimeLock Capsule ensures:  
✅ **No single point of failure**  
✅ **No censorship**  
✅ **Transparent & verifiable unlock conditions**
